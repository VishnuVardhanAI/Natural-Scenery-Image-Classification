# Natural-Scenery-Image-Classification
Image classification of natural scenes using a transfer learning model.

This project consists of:
1. An InceptionNetV3 (with imagenet weights) based transfer learning model used to classify images of natural scenery.
2. A flask deployment of the final model where users can test the model using their own images (from the given image categories).
