# Natural-Scenery-Image-Classification
Image classification of natural scenes using a transfer learning model.

### This project consists of:
1. An InceptionNetV3 (with imagenet weights) based transfer learning model used to classify images of natural scenery.
2. A flask deployment of the final model where users can test the model using their own images (from the given image categories).

### About the dataset:
This dataset contains images of natural scenes from around the world. There are a total of 25K images of size 150x150 divided into 6 categories: Buildings, Forests, Glaciers, Mountains, Sea and Streets. This dataset was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-intel-scene-classification-challe/#About by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.
